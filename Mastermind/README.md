# Mindreader (Mastermind) Game

## Introduction

Mindreader is a fun and challenging number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a 4-digit number chosen by the AI. Each digit in the number is unique, and the player has to guess the exact number within a certain number of attempts. The AI provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the player has guessed correctly or if the digits are out of place.

## Game Rules

1. **Game Setup**:
   - The AI generates a 4-digit number, where each digit is unique.
   - The player has to guess the number in the fewest attempts possible.
   
2. **Feedback**:
   - If the player guesses a digit correctly and in the correct position, a '✅' is displayed for that digit.
   - If the player guesses a digit correctly but in the wrong position, a '⛔' is displayed for that digit.
   - If the digit is not in the number at all, a '❌' is displayed for that digit.

3. **Attempts**:
   - The player is given a maximum number of attempts to guess the number.
   - If the player does not guess the correct number within the allowed attempts, the game ends and the correct number is revealed.
   - The player can choose to play with unlimited attempts by setting a negative or zero number of attempts.

## Features

- **Unique Digits**: The 4-digit number generated by the AI has no repeating digits.
- **Feedback System**: After each guess, the AI provides feedback using '✅', '⛔', and '❌' to guide the player.
- **Flexible Attempts**: Players can decide how many attempts they want to have. Setting a non-positive number of attempts allows them to guess until they get it right.
- **Timer**: The game tracks how long the player takes to guess the number, providing an elapsed time after the game ends.

## Game Flow

1. **Introduction**: The game begins by asking for the player's name and then explaining the rules.
2. **Generating Number**: The AI generates a random 4-digit number with no repeating digits.
3. **Player's Guess**: The player is prompted to make a guess. The game gives feedback for each guess.
4. **Repeat Until Correct or Attempts Exceed**: The game continues until the player guesses the number correctly or exhausts their attempts.
5. **Game Ending**: The game ends with a message indicating whether the player won or lost. The correct number is shown if the player fails to guess it.

## Functions

### `game_opening(name: str)`

**Parameters**:
- `seq_to_guess`: The correct number the player needs to guess (a list of digits).
- `guess`: The player's current guess (a list of digits).

**Returns**:
- A list with '✅', '⛔', and '❌' symbols corresponding to the player's guess.

### `game_ending(result: str, player_name: str, num_attempt: int, seq_to_guess: list)`
This function displays the end message based on the player's result.

**Parameters**:
- `result`: 'good' if the player won, 'bad' if the player lost.
- `player_name`: The name of the player.
- `num_attempt`: The number of attempts allowed.
- `seq_to_guess`: The correct number the player was trying to guess.

### `main_game(num_attempt=5)`
This is the main function that runs the game.

# Auto_mastermind

This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic Mastermind game, where the computer generates a 4-digit number with unique digits, and the player (basically a computer) attempts to guess it. The AI uses a strategy to optimize its guesses based on previous feedback, aiming to solve the puzzle in as few attempts as possible. Additionally, the project includes a feature to plot a histogram of the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number over multiple rounds, providing insights into the AI's performance. The game also measures and records the time taken to complete the game, adding an element of time-tracking to the challenge.

## Conclusion
Enjoy playing Mindreader (Mastermind) or analysing results from auto_mastermind and challenge your friends and family to beat your high score! The game is designed to keep you entertained and test your logical thinking abilities.
