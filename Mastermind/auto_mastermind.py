Name of the game: MindReader (Mastermind)

Rules:

Main settings:
- In this version, it's a computer trying to find the 4 digit number.
- The number guessed can't have the same number within two times.

Game settings:
- If one number in the player guess is good and at the right place in the number to guess sequence,
  a '‚úÖ' sign is displayed.
- If one number in the player guess is good but not at the right place in the number to guess sequence,
  a '‚õî' sign is displayed.
- If neither of the previous conditions are matched, I'll just put a '‚ùå' sign at the place of the wrong guess.
- There was actually no limit of attempts for the player but I'll try to implement this as a parameter.
  for players who would want it.

          Hello Everyone !! 
          
          I'm AI KF23 ü§ñ, we're here today with {name} who will try his best to beat our game.
          Let me introduce you the rules ‚ú®:

          - At the start of the game, I generate a 4-digit number within all digits are unique, your job is to guess this number !!

          - If one number in your guess is good and at the right place in the number to guess sequence, a '‚úÖ' sign is displayed.
          - If one number in your guess is good but not at the right place in the number to guess sequence, a '‚õî' sign is displayed.
          - If neither of the previous conditions are matched, I'll just put a '‚ùå' sign at the place of the wrong guess.
          
          - To finish, I can personnally beat the game in 5 attempts in average ü§ñ
            but if you accept the challenge you can reduce yourself the number of attempts.
            or if you're a coward üëÄ, you can set the number of attempts as a negative number or 0 to play untill you find the number.

          - In this computer version of our game, it's actually interesting to set the way of thinking of the computer
            to make him able to answer correctly in the least amount of attempts.
          
          Let's all enjoy this game üî•, feel free to play at home with your microvaves and servers.
          Now, let's all wish {name} good luck üçÄ cause it'll be needed !!
