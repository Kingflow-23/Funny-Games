# Pac-Man Inspired Game

## Overview
This is a Scratch Pac-Man-inspired game where the player navigates a character using arrow keys to eat apples and progress through levels. The goal is to eat 10 apples consecutively to move to the next level. The game's difficulty increases as bots speed up after the player eats 5 apples. The game is endless, designed purely for fun.
